# Puppeteer (Ascension)

Unit-frames addon for healers, ported from [OldManAlpha/Puppeteer](https://github.com/OldManAlpha/Puppeteer) to **WotLK 3.3.5a / Project Ascension**. Originally HealersMate. Aims to be a viable alternative to Cell, VuhDo, or Healbot on the 3.3.5a private-server scene.

`/pt` opens the configuration menu.

## Status

**v2.0 — port complete.** The addon runs on stock 3.3.5a clients with no external client mods. Tested on **Bronzebeard / Warcraft Reborn** (Project Ascension's Classic+ realm). It should work on any 3.3.5a-based Ascension realm; the classless-realm specifics (Area 52 / Conquest of Azeroth) are tracked separately — see [Roadmap](#roadmap).

If you used the original Vanilla 1.12 addon, see [What changed from 1.12](#what-changed-from-the-112-version) below.

## Features

- Health, power, marks, aggro, PvP status, and relevant buffs/debuffs for party, raid, pets, and targets
- **Secure click-cast** — bind mouse clicks, the mouse wheel, and keys (with any combination of Shift/Ctrl/Alt) to spells, macros, items, custom Lua scripts, or popup menus. Works in combat
- **Hover-to-cast keybinds** — keys cast on the unit frame the cursor is over without clicking, in or out of combat
- **Aura tracking with native countdown sweep** — buffs and debuffs from `UnitAura`, with the standard 3.3.5a `Cooldown` swirl driving the timer
- **Mystic-aware dispel highlighting** — debuff types you can dispel are colorized on every frame, including dispels granted by Mystic Enchantments (e.g. "Remove Curse" learned by a Priest will cause Curse-type debuffs to colorize). Updates on `SPELLS_CHANGED` without `/reload`
- **Self-cast incoming-heal bar** — predicts your own incoming heals on the target's bar from a learned-amount cache populated via the combat log
- **Bound-spell tooltip** — hover a frame to see your current power, every bound spell, and its mana cost
- **Roles** — assign per-player tank / healer / DPS labels for organization
- **Multi-language UI** — non-English locales supported via `locale/Locale.lua`

### Bindings

<img align="right" width="36%" src="https://i.imgur.com/KoFygXv.png">

Mouse buttons, the mouse wheel, and keys can all be bound, with any combination of Shift/Ctrl/Alt. Bindings can hold spells, macros, items, custom Lua scripts (out of combat), or popup menus that hold further bindings. The `/pt` configuration UI lets you pick a different binding set per loadout, and per-target hostility (friendly vs hostile).

### Spells at a glance

Hovering over a unit frame shows your power, your bindings on that target, and each spell's cost.

## Installation

1. Download the repository (Code → Download ZIP, or `git clone`).
2. Extract / move it into your client's add-on directory so the path is `<Ascension>/Interface/AddOns/Puppeteer/`. **The folder name must be exactly `Puppeteer`** — Ascension's loader will refuse the addon if the folder is suffixed (`Puppeteer-main`, `Puppeteer-Ascension`, etc.).
3. Launch the client and enable Puppeteer in the AddOns list. Type `/pt` in chat to open the configuration UI.

This addon coexists with ElvUI (and other unit-frame addons) — ElvUI's frames hide Puppeteer's cast bar, but there is no taint or click-cast interference between the two.

## What changed from the 1.12 version

This fork rewrites the Vanilla-only subsystems against native 3.3.5a APIs. If you used the original addon, the practical differences:

- **No SuperWoW / UnitXP SP3 / Nampower / VanillaUtils.** Those mods don't exist on 3.3.5a; the features that depended on them are either rebuilt natively (auras, aggro, click-cast) or removed.
- **Heal prediction is self-cast only.** The 3.3.5a `UNIT_SPELLCAST_*` events don't carry the cast's target, so we can only predict your own heals. A learned-amount cache (`PTHealCache` / `PTPlayerHealCache`) populates from the combat log.
- **Multi-focus is removed.** Native 3.3.5a `focus` is single-slot; the SuperWoW-only `focus2..N` token system is gone. Single-slot native focus restoration is on the v2.1 list.
- **Distance / line-of-sight indicators are removed.** Both relied on UnitXP SP3.
- **Click-cast is now secure.** Per-frame `SecureActionButton` overlays and hidden `SetBindingClick`-routed keybind buttons replace the old insecure dispatcher, so clicks and hover-key-casts work in combat without triggering taint.

### Setting caveats worth knowing

- **`Cast When (Keys)` (Key Up vs Key Down)** is honored only on the legacy insecure path. On the secure path (default) keybinds always fire on key-down — that's how Blizzard's `SetBindingClick` works, not something we can override without giving up secure-template benefits. The setting still applies to `Menu` / `Role` / `Macro` / `Script` / `Multi` binding types (which keep using the legacy dispatcher) and to the whole legacy path if you turn off `UseSecureClickCast`.
- **In-range / out-of-range darkening uses `CheckInteractDistance`'s fixed ~28-yd bracket.** Stock 3.3.5a doesn't expose precise yard distances; the upstream addon got that from UnitXP SP3 / SuperWoW. Frame darkening still works for "in range / out of range" signaling, just at coarser granularity. The Vanilla addon's directional out-of-range arrow has been removed entirely (it relied on precise unit positions and facing angles that 3.3.5a doesn't expose).
- **Settings GUI is blocked in combat.** Opening or staying in `/pt` while in combat would taint secure-attribute writes to the click-cast overlays, so the GUI auto-closes on `PLAYER_REGEN_DISABLED` and refuses to open while in combat. Edit bindings between pulls.
- **Various TWoW / SuperWoW Experiments are gone.** The "Mods" tab, "Set Mouseover" checkbox, "(SuperWoW) Cast Icons" experiment, "(TWoW) LFT Auto Role" checkbox, "(TWoW) Auto Role" experiment, the directional Out-of-Range Arrow, and the HealersMate auto-import have all been removed because their underlying client mods, addon-channel protocols, or sibling addons don't exist on 3.3.5a.

## Roadmap

- **v2.0 (current)** — port to 3.3.5a complete. Stable for healing on Bronzebeard.
- **v2.1** — single-slot native focus restoration; possible workarounds for predicting other players' incoming heals; classless-realm support (Area 52 / CoA) once a real user surfaces there.
- **v3.0** — styling system redesign. The bespoke unit-frame implementation will be replaced with vendored [oUF](https://github.com/oUF-wow/oUF) (from the ElvUI-WotLK source), token-based theming, [LibSharedMedia-3.0](https://www.wowace.com/projects/libsharedmedia-3-0) integration, and AceDB-3.0 persistence. The current 770-line `ProfileManager.lua` preset literal and the per-property Customize tab go away in favor of declarative themes with diff-based overrides. Parked until v2.0 has accumulated real raid use.

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>Click to view</summary>

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| **Click-casting doesn't work on some bindings in combat** | Bindings of type Menu / Role / Macro / Script / Multi still fall through to the legacy insecure dispatcher and produce "Interface action failed" inside combat. Use Spell / Target / Assist / Follow bindings for combat-critical actions. The legacy dispatcher gets cleaned up once the secure path has soaked in real raid use. |
| **My Priest doesn't have Dispel Magic / Cure Disease** | On Bronzebeard, base Priests must purchase Dispel Magic and Cure Disease from the trainer rather than learning them automatically — that's an Ascension ruleset choice, not a Puppeteer issue. Once you train them (or pick up an equivalent dispel via a Mystic Enchantment), Puppeteer detects them and colorizes the matching debuff types. |
| **Adding a binding crashes or doesn't update in combat** | The settings UI is blocked from opening (and auto-closes) inside combat to prevent secure-attribute taint. Edit bindings between pulls. |
